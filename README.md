Physics_Notes
=============

All of my physics notes. (From the time when I started writing them in LaTeX)

If you wish to use them for your studies then you must compile them first. I've done this to encourage people to make their own notes. If you're clever enough to compile a .TeX file then you can have them as your reward :P
