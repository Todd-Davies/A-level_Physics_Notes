Physics_Notes
=============

These are all of my (digitally formatted) A-level Physics notes.

They are written in LaTeX, and so must be compiled in order to be viewed. If you cannot compile LaTeX documents, then you can head to my website where I'll put the .pdf files (I'll do this soon).

Please consider, while obviously I try to make accurate and detailed notes, there are probably a great number of mistakes in here. I often annotate hard copies of my notes (and then forget to update the digital versions) so many mistakes may have persisted in here even after I've noticed them!
