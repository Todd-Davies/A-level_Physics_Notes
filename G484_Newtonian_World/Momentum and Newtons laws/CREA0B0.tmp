Learn these, sometimes you've got to state them on the exam.
\subsection*{Newton's first law}
\textbf{Definition:} \textit{An object will remain at rest or keep travelling at a constant velocity unless it is acted on by an external force.}\\
Another way of saying this is that the momentum of an object is constant unless an external force acts upon it.
\subsection*{Newton's second law}
\textbf{Definition:} \textit{The net force acting on an object is directly proportional to the rate of change of the linear momentum of that object. The net force and the change in momentum are in the same direction.}\\
This means that 
\[
	net\:force \propto rate\:of\:change\:of\:momentum
\]
Which can also be written as:
\[
	F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}
\]
\textit{N.b. the Newton is defined so that there doesn't need to be a constant to turn the proportional sign into an equals sign.}\\
Where:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
		\hline
			Quantity & Abbreviation & Unit \\ \hline
			Change in momentum & $\Delta p$ & Kilogram meter per second ($kgms^{-1}$) \\ \hline
			Change in time & $\Delta t$ & Second ($s$) \\ \hline
			Force & $F$ & Newton ($N$) \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
This can also be defined as:\\
\textbf{Alternate definition:} \textit{The net force on an object is equal to the rate of change of it's momentum. The next force and the change in momentum are in the same direction}

\subsubsection*{An extension of the second law}
We can change $\Delta p$ into $mv - mu$. Since $m$ is constant, we can take it out as a factor like so:
\[
	F = m\frac{v - m}{\Delta t}
\]
You may have noticed that we can then substitute the second half of the equation for acceleration (since acceleration is the rate of change of the speed):
\[
	F = ma
\]
\subsection*{Newton's third law}
This is the easy one! It's definition is as follows: \textit{When two bodies interact, the forces that they exert on each other are equal and opposite}.\\
These two forces are always:\\
However, most people know it by this definition:
\textbf{Alternate definition:} \textit{Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Of the same type (e.g. magnetic)
	\item Are equal in magnitude
	\item Are opposite in direction
	\item Act on different bodies (usually the two bodies that are creating the force)
\end{itemize}
