\section*{What's an oscillation?}
\thispagestyle{empty}
An oscillation is defined as a '\textit{A repetitive back and forth motion}' (an object that oscillates can also be said to vibrate).

\section*{Equations you need to know}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The angular velocity is related to the time period of the oscillation with the following equation:
	\[
		\omega = \frac{2 \pi}{T}
	\]
	Which is of course equal to:
	\[
	 \omega = 2 \pi f
	\]
	\item In simple harmonic motion, displacement can be calculated using the following:
	\[
		x = A \sin (2 \pi ft)
	\]
	or
	\[
		x = A \cos(2 \pi ft)
	\]
	\item The acceleration of a body undergoing simple harmonic motion is proportional to it's displacement from the equlibrium position:
	\[
		a \propto x
	\]
	We can include the constant in the equation to give:
	\[
		a = -(2 \pi f)^{2}x
	\]
	\item The maximum speed of an object undergoing simple harmonic motion can be found using:
	\[
		v_{max} = (2 \pi f)A
	\]
\end{itemize}

The quantities and their respective units are shown in this table:

\section*{Types of oscillation}
There are two types of oscillation - free and forced.
\subsection*{Free oscillations}
This is when an object is left to vibrate at it's \textit{natural frequency}. The oscillating object is under no external influence (other than the influence that initiated the motion). 

An example of a free oscillation could be when you pluck a violin string. The string oscillates at its natural frequency which produces the note that you hear.
\subsection*{Forced oscillations}
A forced oscillation is when an object moves back and forth under the influence of another driving object.

An example of this is if you wave your hand at somebody. Your arm is driving your hand, but your hand isn't moving at it's natural frequency.

\section*{Describing an oscillation}
Oscillations have maximum velocity at the point where their displacement is zero. At this point, they have minimum acceleration.
Oscillations have maximum acceleration at the point where their displacement is maximum. At this point they have minimum velocity.
The shape of a graph plotting displacement against time is going to be something like:

\begin{tikzpicture}
%\draw (0,0) sin (1,1) cos (2,0) sin (3,-1) cos (4,0) sin (5,1);%
\draw [domain=0:4*pi] plot (\x, {sin(\x r)});
% zero crossing
\draw[dotted] (0,0) -- (5,0);
\end{tikzpicture}
