\section*{What is gravity?}
\thispagestyle{empty}
Gravity is the attraction between all matter and is one of the four fundamental forces of the universe. Large objects such as planets have a very strong gravity, while smaller objects have a weaker gravity. Gravity has an inverse square relationship between strength and distance, the closer two objects get to each other, the larger the force between them.

Gravity can be represented by field lines. These have arrows that show the direction of the gravitational field on a mass placed in the field, and the spacing of the lines indicates the strength of the field (a more dense spacing corresponds to a stronger field).

We can treat most objects as a point mass when we're working with them in relation to the gravitational fields they produce and interact with. The point is centred around the centre of gravity of the object.


\section*{Equations you need to know}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The gravitational field strength at a point is equal the the gravitational force exerted per unit mass on an object placed at the point:
	\[
		g = \frac{F}{m}
	\]
	\item The equation for Newton's law of gravitation states is:
	\[
		F = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}
	\]
	\item The gravitational field strength at a specified distance from a point or spherical mass is given by:
	\[
		g = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
	\]
	\item Kepler's third law of planetary motion relates the orbital period to the orbital radius in the following equation:
	\[
		T^2 \propto r^3
	\]
	\item The orbital speed of a planet is determined using the equation:
	\[
		v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}
	\]
\end{itemize}

The quantities and their respective units are shown in this table:

\section*{Newton's law of gravitation}
\textbf{Definition:} Any two point masses attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation.

In my opinion that's a bit wordy, so my advice is to define the equations and state the terms. If the question wants lots of marks then state that it's a inverse square law too. The word point mass is interchangeable with the word particle (which probably doesn't mean anything unless you've done a maths mechanics).

We can derive the equation of Newton's law of gravitation like so:
\[
	F \propto Mm
\]
and
\[
	F \propro \frac{1}{r^2}
\]
We can combine these two equations to give:
\[
	F \propto \frac{Mm}{r^2}
\]
If we get rid of the proportional sign by adding a constant, we end up with Newton's law of gravitation:
\[
	F = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}
\]
\textit{N.b. the minus sign is there to show that the force is attractive.}

We measure the distance $r$ between the masses from the centre of gravity of one point to the centre of gravity of another. The two bodies attract each other with equal and opposite forces (think Newton's third law).

\section*{Deriving Kepler's law}
\textbf{This isn't on the syllabus, but if you're extra clever you might like to read it}

Kepler's law states that: $T^2 \propto r^3$. Here is how to derive it from the following three equations:

\begin{itemize}

\item Newton's law of gravitation: $F = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}$

\item The centripetal force equation: $F = \frac{mv^2}{r}$

\item The equation for the speed of an object travelling in a circle: $v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T}$

\end{itemize}


Put Newton's law of gravitation and the centripetal force equation equal to each other:

$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$

Divide both sides by $r$:

$\frac{GMm}{r} = mv^2$

Sub in $v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T}$ for $v$:

$\frac{GMm}{r} = m(\frac{2 \pi r}{T})^2$

Divide both sides by $m$:

$\frac{GM}{r} = (\frac{2 \pi r}{T})^2$

Root both sides:

$\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} = \frac{2 \pi r}{T}$

Flip both sides and divide by $2 \pi r$:

$T = \frac{2 \pi r}{\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}}$

Now we have Kepler's law, sort of, we it just needs simplifying:

Multiply both sides by $\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$:

$T \times \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} = 2 \pi r$

Square both sides:

$T^2 \times \frac{GM}{r} = (2 \pi r)^2$

Divide both sides by $\frac{GM}{r}$:

$T^2 = \frac{(2 \pi r)^2}{\frac{GM}{r}}$

Clean it up:

$T^2 = \frac{(2 \pi r)^2 \times r}{GM}$

Take out $r$ to get the final answer:

$T^2 = \frac{(2 \pi)^2}{GM}r^3$

If you take out the constant you get Kepler's law:

$T^2 \propto r^3$
